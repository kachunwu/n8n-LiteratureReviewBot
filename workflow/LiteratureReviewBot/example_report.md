## Introduction

**Reward Prediction Error (RPE)** and **Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)** are fundamental concepts in cognitive neuroscience, providing crucial insights into how the brain perceives, learns from, and adapts to environmental feedback. Their integration bridges computational neural processes with observable behavioral outcomes, particularly within the frameworks of reinforcement learning and cognitive control.

**Reward Prediction Error (RPE)** is defined as the difference between expected and actual rewards in a given context—a central concept from reinforcement learning theory. RPEs are essential for an organism's ability to optimize behavior under uncertainty and changing circumstances. A positive RPE occurs when outcomes exceed expectations, while a negative RPE indicates unfavorable surprises. These discrepancies drive continuous updating of value estimates, thereby enhancing behavioral flexibility and adaptive action selection (Deng et al., 2023; Yao, 2024).

The neural substrates of RPE coding are predominantly dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain's ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. These neurons show bidirectional changes in firing rates related to the sign and magnitude of RPEs, serving as vital teaching signals for learning from reward feedback. Functional neuroimaging and neurophysiological research identify robust RPE-related activation in the ventral striatum, specifically the nucleus accumbens, with cortical regions like the prefrontal cortex and amygdala contributing context-sensitive modulation during learning and choice. These interconnected circuits promote the flexible encoding of expectancy-outcome discrepancies, driving efficient adaptive learning and optimal decision-making (Glimcher, 2011; Deng et al., 2023; Schultz, 2016).

**Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)** are scalp-recorded electrophysiological signals derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG), capturing the brain’s time-locked responses to distinct sensory, motor, or cognitive events. By averaging EEG epochs aligned to specific stimuli or responses, researchers identify discrete ERP components, each characterized by latency, polarity, scalp distribution, and responsiveness to experimental manipulation. Early components (e.g., P1, N1) primarily reflect exogenous sensory processing, while later components (e.g., N2, P3, FRN) index higher-order cognitive, evaluative, and attentional processes (Sur & Sinha, 2009; Luck, 2005).

The main advantage of ERPs is their millisecond-scale temporal resolution, which allows precise tracking of the sequential dynamics underlying perception, decision-making, and cognitive control. This makes ERPs uniquely suited for dissecting rapid neural evaluations during feedback processing and reinforcement learning. Particularly notable is the *feedback-related negativity* (FRN), a component peaking approximately 200–300 ms post-feedback, which is sensitive to mismatches between expected and actual outcomes—a neural signature closely associated with RPE computations (Shams & Fadlallah, 2020).

Exploring the interplay between RPE and ERP dynamics is crucial for delineating the neurobiological mechanisms of feedback-based learning, error monitoring, and cognitive adaptation. ERPs provide direct temporal access to neural events triggered by outcome surprise, offering evidence complementary to hemodynamic and molecular imaging modalities. Unraveling how specific ERP components track RPEs not only advances theoretical models of reinforcement learning but also elucidates pathophysiological changes observed in clinical conditions such as addiction, depression, and schizophrenia (Neural Data Science, 2024).

In summary, the frameworks of RPE and ERPs jointly advance cognitive neuroscience, deepening our understanding of how the brain detects and responds to environmental contingencies and flexibly adapts its behavior in the face of changing expectations and outcomes.

## Background and Context

The theoretical foundations of **Reward Prediction Error (RPE)** lie at the intersection of predictive coding and reinforcement learning—frameworks describing how organisms adaptively interact with uncertain environments. Predictive coding posits that the brain perpetually generates expectations about sensory inputs and systematically updates internal models based on discrepancies between prediction and reality (Friston, 2010). In this paradigm, RPE is a quantifiable signal that measures the gap between expected and actual results, fueling iterative refinement of future predictions and actions. Reinforcement learning, grounded in computational neuroscience, formalizes this adaptation using algorithms in which RPEs act as critical feedback for adjusting action policies and value estimations (Sutton & Barto, 2018).

RPE signals are categorized as positive or negative: positive RPEs reinforce behaviors associated with unexpectedly favorable outcomes, while negative RPEs discourage the repetition of actions yielding disappointing results. These signals shape not only overt behavior but also cognitive domains such as attentional resource allocation, decision-making, and inhibitory control, supporting continuous adaptation in dynamic contexts (Garrison et al., 2013; Holroyd & Coles, 2002). Dopaminergic pathways within the midbrain and prefrontal cortex are central to RPE signaling, highlighting their fundamental role across neural systems.

**Event-related potential (ERP)** methodology is widely adopted for investigating the rapid neural dynamics underlying RPE computation. ERPs consist of voltage fluctuations extracted from the ongoing EEG signal, time-locked to specific sensory or cognitive events. Data acquisition involves strategic scalp electrode placement to detect minute, temporally specific changes in electrical activity from synchronized cortical neuron firing. Averaging EEG epochs across numerous trials isolates stimulus-specific activity from background noise, improving detection sensitivity (Luck, 2014).

ERP waveforms comprise multiple components, classified by polarity (positive/negative) and latency (time post-stimulus). Key components for RPE and cognitive control research include the N100 (\~100 ms), P200 (\~200 ms), P300 (\~300 ms), and the feedback-related negativity (FRN; 200–300 ms post-feedback). The N100 and P200 are associated with early sensory processing and attentional mechanisms, whereas the P300 is linked to cognitive updating and evaluation. The FRN is particularly sensitive to prediction errors during feedback and aligns with RPE signals in reinforcement learning paradigms (Donchin & Coles, 1988; Gehring & Willoughby, 2004).

The primary advantage of ERPs is their millisecond-level temporal precision, which allows the detailed examination of the timing of neural processes underlying outcome evaluation, learning, and adaptive behavior (Luck, 2014). By tracing ERP components across varying stages of information processing, RPE research provides exceptional insight into the neural mechanisms of flexible learning from feedback.

## Neural Mechanisms of Reward Prediction Error

Dopaminergic mechanisms underlying **reward prediction error (RPE)** are central to adaptive learning and decision-making. Anatomically, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are the key origins of phasic dopamine signals. These neurons show transient increases in firing rate in response to unexpected rewards or reward-predicting cues (positive RPE), and decreased firing when anticipated rewards are omitted (negative RPE) (Diederen & Fletcher, 2023).

The nucleus accumbens (NAc), within the ventral striatum, acts as a major recipient of VTA dopamine projections and integrates reward context, motivational salience, and outcome evaluation. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides top-down expected value cues, influencing dopaminergic computation of RPEs for informed decision strategies. Limbic regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus, further modulate VTA and NAc responses to emotionally salient or context-rich cues, ultimately shaping the encoding and updating of stimulus-outcome associations (Deperrois et al., 2019).

Local microcircuits in the VTA, especially GABAergic interneurons, fine-tune dopaminergic neuron output by integrating signals representing both reward receipt and expectation. These circuits ensure the accuracy of RPE computation by merging predictions with actual outcomes, maintaining the reliability of this essential learning signal (Cohen & Haesler et al., n.d.).

At the neural coding level, there is a notable asymmetry: positive prediction errors elicit strong bursts of dopaminergic activity, while negative prediction errors (unexpected reward omission) result in firing pauses rather than sustained decreases. This asymmetry suggests learning systems may be more sensitive to positive errors, reinforcing behaviors leading to successful outcomes (Schultz et al., 1997).

Computationally, RPE signals correspond closely to the Temporal Difference (TD) Reinforcement Learning model; this framework explains learning as the ongoing adjustment of value estimates based on discrepancies between predicted and actual rewards. The BBG model (Beierlein-Brown-Goldreich) also offers a biologically plausible account in which VTA dopamine neurons integrate reward receipt and expected value signals from regions such as the PFC and NAc—accurately capturing the interplay between basal ganglia and brainstem circuits involved in RPE-mediated behavior (Deperrois et al., 2019).

The dopaminergic RPE system underpins a broad range of adaptive behaviors, enabling the assignment of credit or blame for outcomes and facilitating future behavioral adjustment. Disruption of this system contributes to affective and cognitive disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia, where aberrant learning from reward and punishment results in maladaptive behavior patterns (Keiflin & Janak, 2015).

## Characteristics and Types of Event-Related Potentials

**Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)** are brief voltage fluctuations in the brain triggered by discrete sensory, cognitive, or motor events. Measured noninvasively via electroencephalography (EEG), ERPs offer remarkable temporal precision in characterizing information processing within neural networks (Blackwood & Muir, 1990). The following section details the essential features, classification, and methodological considerations of ERP analysis.

### Defining Characteristics of ERPs

  * **Time-locked and Phase-locked Properties:** ERPs are reliably reproducible, consistently appearing at the same temporal interval after stimulus onset across trials. This temporal consistency (time-locking and phase-locking) allows the isolation of ERP features from ongoing EEG activity (Blackwood & Muir, 1990; Luck, 2014).
  * **Small Amplitude:** ERP components are subtle—often just a few microvolts—necessitating averaging across many trials to distinguish them from background activity (Blackwood & Muir, 1990).
  * **High Temporal Resolution:** ERPs are measured with millisecond precision, facilitating detailed analysis of neural processing sequences (Luck, 2014).
  * **Polarity and Latency:** Components are classified by polarity (positive/negative) and timing post-stimulus (latency). For instance, the "P300" represents a positive deflection around 300 ms after stimulus onset, with polarity and latency aiding psychological and neural process mapping (Coles & Rugg, 1997).

### Sensory (Exogenous) versus Cognitive (Endogenous) Components

ERP components are broadly divided into two main categories:

  * **Sensory (Exogenous) Components:** Early components (usually within 100 ms post-stimulus) are shaped by the physical attributes of stimuli and are relatively unaffected by higher-order cognitive factors. Examples include the P1 and N1 in visual/auditory paradigms (Blackwood & Muir, 1990).
  * **Cognitive (Endogenous) Components:** Later components are sensitive to cognitive variables (e.g., attention, expectation, memory). The P300 is a canonical endogenous component associated with stimulus evaluation and context updating, while the N400 indexes semantic incongruence in language processing (Luck, 2014; Coles & Rugg, 1997).

### Recording, Measurement, and Analysis Methods

  * **Recording:** ERPs are recorded from scalp electrodes (e.g., using the 10-20 international system), digitized, and averaged across trials to reduce unrelated EEG noise (Luck, 2014).
  * **Component Identification:** Researchers identify ERP components by observing characteristic peaks/deflections in averaged waveforms based on latency, polarity, and scalp topography (Coles & Rugg, 1997).
  * **Amplitude and Latency Analysis:** Quantitative analyses involve measuring voltage differences (amplitude) and peak timing (latency), which are sensitive to both stimulus and cognitive manipulations (Luck, 2014).
  * **Source Localization:** While ERPs have limited spatial resolution, computational modeling (e.g., dipole fitting, distributed source imaging) aids in approximating underlying cortical generators (Swick & Kutas, 1994).
  * **Sensitivity to Task Demands:** Especially for endogenous components, ERP metrics vary with task instructions, effort, load, and expectation, making them powerful indicators of underlying cognitive functions (Blackwood & Muir, 1990; Luck, 2014).

## ERP Correlates of Reward Prediction Error

The neural computations underlying **reward prediction error (RPE)** manifest robustly in several distinctive ERP components within human EEG recordings. Most significant among these are the **Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN)**, **Error-Related Negativity (ERN)**, and **Reward Positivity (RewP)**, each defined by unique eliciting conditions, timing, scalp topography, and functional significance in reward processing.

### Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN)

The **FRN** is a fronto-central negative deflection occurring \~200–300 ms after external feedback, often maximal at FCz/Cz electrode sites (Walsh & Anderson, 2012; Frömer et al., 2021). It reflects rapid evaluation of action outcomes, especially in the context of negative prediction errors. FRN amplitude increases for unexpected negative outcomes (i.e., greater negative RPEs) and is modulated by expectancy, with larger amplitudes for improbable losses. The FRN thus encodes the quantitative aspects of prediction error signals and can be elicited even in the absence of overt responses, underscoring its broad role in feedback monitoring.

### Error-Related Negativity (ERN)

The **ERN** is a response-locked ERP, peaking 50–100 ms after an incorrect action. It shares the fronto-central distribution of the FRN and is thought to originate from the anterior cingulate cortex (Stolz, 2017). The ERN reflects rapid, internal error detection processes independent of external feedback and is most pronounced when errors are made with subjective confidence. Its amplitude weakens under uncertainty (e.g., early learning phases). ERN supports cognitive control and facilitates quick behavior correction before feedback arrives.

### Reward Positivity (RewP)

**RewP**, occurring in a similar temporal interval as the FRN (200–300 ms post-feedback), appears as a relative positivity after unexpectedly rewarding feedback (Frömer et al., 2021). It shares the topography of the FRN but indexes positive RPEs, with amplitude enhancement for rare/unexpected rewards and reduction when rewards are expected or absent. The RewP provides a neural correlate for the reinforcement of actions leading to favorable outcomes (Hird et al., 2014).

### Modulation by Reward Expectancy and Outcome Valence

FRN and RewP amplitudes are both dynamically modulated by the interplay of expectancy and outcome valence. The FRN is most salient for unexpected losses (negative RPEs), whereas RewP peaks for unexpected gains (positive RPEs). The ERN is mainly modulated by subjective response confidence, tracking expectancy violation associated with action, rather than feedback valence (Hajcak et al., 2005).

### Collective Role as Electrophysiological Markers of RPE

Together, FRN, RewP, and ERN constitute a network of rapid electrophysiological signals mapping onto core elements of reinforcement learning. While FRN and RewP track externally-generated RPEs, the ERN is essential for internal self-monitoring. Their sensitivity to expectancy, valence, and feedback probability solidifies these components' role as markers for reward learning processes (Walsh & Anderson, 2012; Frömer et al., 2021; Hird et al., 2014).

## Functional Implications

The **reward prediction error (RPE)** signal is a central mechanism in learning and decision-making, encoding mismatches between expected and actual outcomes. This error signal initiates neural processes that drive updates of future expectations, guiding adaptive behavior within reinforcement learning paradigms (Garrison et al., 2010).

### ERP-RPE Signals and Adaptive Behavior

EEG studies reveal that RPEs are robustly captured by ERP components, most notably the **feedback-related negativity (FRN)**. The FRN, occurring 200–300 ms after feedback, is sensitive to outcome valence, with larger amplitudes for negative RPEs (unexpectedly poor outcomes). This quality designates the FRN as a neural marker of prediction error, influencing subsequent decision-making and action adjustment (Murray & Holroyd, 2024).

### Neurobiological Underpinnings: Link to Dopamine

Phasic activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons underlies the signaling of RPEs. Increases in firing encode positive RPEs (outcomes better than expected); decreases encode negative RPEs. This dopaminergic teaching signal is fundamental for synaptic plasticity and updating value estimates in reinforcement learning processes (Schultz, 2015).

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), implicated as a generator of the FRN, is densely innervated by dopaminergic projections. This anatomical and functional convergence establishes a neurobiological link between dopaminergic dynamics and ERP markers such as the FRN, unifying neurochemical and electrophysiological accounts of outcome processing (Hajcak et al., 2012).

### Behavioral and Clinical Relevance

In reinforcement learning tasks, ERP-RPE signals drive trial-by-trial adaptation of action values, steering optimal choice policies and supporting the exploration-exploitation balance (Osinsky et al., 2015). Emotional factors can modulate the strength and efficacy of these signals, reflecting the interplay between affect and adaptive learning.

Perturbations in the dopamine–RPE–ERP axis occur in several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Addiction involves distorted RPE signaling leading to compulsive behaviors and impaired learning from negative outcomes. In schizophrenia, dysfunctional dopamine transmission impairs RPE computation and undermines adaptive decision-making. Parkinson’s disease, associated with dopaminergic system degeneration, disrupts RPE-driven learning and motor adaptation (Schultz, 2015; Garrison et al., 2010).

## Research Gaps and Future Directions

Despite substantial progress, several research gaps and methodological challenges remain in the study of **Reward Prediction Error (RPE)** and **Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)**. Understanding these limitations is key to advancing the field.

### Current Limitations

1.  **Disentangling Overlapping ERP Components:** Overlap between components such as FRN and P3 complicates the clear attribution of neural signals to discrete psychological processes. This can obscure mechanistic interpretations and limit theoretical progress (Cohen et al., 2007; Walsh & Anderson, 2012).
2.  **Inconsistencies in Modulation by Outcome Probability:** Studies yield mixed findings regarding the effect of outcome probability on ERP amplitude, with outcomes varying based on task parameters, participant expectations, and methodological choices (Cohen et al., 2007; Walsh & Anderson, 2012; Pier et al., 2021).
3.  **Limited Spatial Resolution:** While temporally precise, ERPs offer limited spatial localization compared to fMRI or MEG, hampering the identification of precise neural circuits underlying RPEs (Hauser et al., 2023).
4.  **Undercharacterized Neural Circuitry Beyond Dopamine:** Most ERP studies focus on dopaminergic systems; however, other neuromodulatory and anatomical circuits (e.g., serotonergic, noradrenergic, cortical) also play critical roles that are currently underexplored (Hauser et al., 2023; Walsh & Anderson, 2012).
5.  **Methodological Variability in ERP Measurement:** Differences in experimental design, participant learning trajectories, feedback structuring, and data pre-processing procedures can introduce variability, sometimes masking important features of RPE processing (Cohen et al., 2007; Walsh & Anderson, 2012).
6.  **Limited Integration with Computational Models:** Few ERP studies formally integrate reinforcement learning models for mapping ERP signals onto theoretical constructs like prediction error magnitude, learning rates, and confidence (Walsh & Anderson, 2012; Hauser et al., 2023).

### Proposed Future Directions

1.  **Advanced Signal Decomposition and Source Localization:** Techniques such as ICA or machine learning classifiers, coupled with advanced source localization algorithms (e.g., LORETA, beamforming), can untangle overlapping components and improve anatomical specificity (Walsh & Anderson, 2012).
2.  **Multimodal Neuroimaging:** Combining ERP with modalities such as fMRI or MEG leverages the complementary strengths of each approach, providing both high temporal and spatial resolution to delineate reward processing networks (Hauser et al., 2023).
3.  **Integrative Computational Approaches:** Adoption of explicit reinforcement learning and Bayesian modeling will improve the interpretive bridge between ERP data and theoretical constructs (Cohen et al., 2007; Walsh & Anderson, 2012).
4.  **Systematic Manipulation and Measurement of Expectancy and Confidence:** Experimental designs that directly vary and measure subjective expectancy and confidence can clarify their respective contributions to ERP signatures of RPE (Pier et al., 2021).
5.  **Explorations Beyond Dopamine:** Studies using pharmacological or advanced imaging approaches should further investigate the influence of other neuromodulatory systems on RPE-related ERPs (Hauser et al., 2023).
6.  **Clinical and Developmental Applications:** Expansion into studies of clinical and developmental populations will support the generalizability and translational impact of ERP-RPE models (Walsh & Anderson, 2012).

## Conclusion

The intricate interplay between **Reward Prediction Error (RPE)** and **Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)** forms the foundation of learning, decision-making, and cognitive control. Contemporary research demonstrates that RPEs—quantifying the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes—manifest in specific ERP components, especially the **Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN)** and **Error-Related Negativity (ERN)**. These ERP markers offer temporally precise indices of the neural dynamics underlying outcome evaluation, expectancy, and motivational relevance, thus serving as robust electrophysiological signals of feedback-based learning (Walsh & Anderson, 2012).

The neurochemical basis of RPEs, particularly dopaminergic signaling, provides explanatory depth for both the computational and behavioral impacts of these processes. Midbrain dopamine neurons encode prediction error magnitudes and valences, guiding reinforcement learning and producing the phasic changes in ERP amplitude observed following outcome surprise. The convergence of dopaminergic modulation and electrophysiological markers such as the FRN and ERN underpins a cohesive model of learning and cognitive adaptation, highlighting the integration of neurochemical and electrical systems (Deng, 2023; Keiflin & Janak, 2015).

In the context of learning and decision-making, RPEs act as real-time signals updating value representations—driving individuals toward more rewarding choices. The FRN, as a neural correlate, scales with outcome probability and valence, facilitating behavioral adjustment based on feedback. This mechanism extends to cognitive control, with ERN reflecting performance monitoring and conflict detection, reinforcing the interdependence of electrophysiological and neurochemical processes (Walsh & Anderson, 2012; Holroyd & Coles, 2002).

Clinical applications of RPE-ERP research are increasingly evident. Disorders such as addiction, depression, and schizophrenia—marked by altered reward processing and impaired cognitive control—present distinctive anomalies in FRN and ERN responses. These ERP signatures not only aid diagnosis and monitoring but also inform the development of targeted interventions and personalized therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders. The temporal resolution and noninvasiveness of ERP further enhance its value as a clinical tool (Keiflin & Janak, 2015).

Moving forward, integrating electrophysiological and neurochemical methods—such as combining EEG/ERP with PET or fMRI—will clarify the complex, multimodal dynamics underpinning learning and adaptation. Computational reinforcement learning models, when paired with ERP analysis, promise greater specificity in connecting theory with biology. Such innovations will facilitate translation from basic neuroscience to clinical practice and deepen our capacity to address cognitive and affective dysfunction across diverse patient populations (Deng, 2023; Syed et al., 2023).
